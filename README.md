Virtual Assistants are software programs that help you ease your day to day tasks, such as showing weather report. creating reminders, making shopping lists etc. They can take commands via text (online chat bots) or by voice. Voice based intelligent assistants need an invoking word or wake word to activate the listener, followed by the command. For my project the wake word is JIA. We have so many virtual assistants, such as Apple's Siri. Amazon's Alexa and Microsoft's Cortana. For this project, wake word was chosen JIA
